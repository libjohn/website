## My Workshops

I provide a [series of workshops](workshops.html) on R and OpenRefine. Typical topics include twitter gathering, web scraping, data parsing, and data cleaning.  Each workshop is designed as a hands-on experience where you can download the practice data, the presentation slides, and workbook guides.  Accompanying recording of the workshops are available.

## Data & Visualization Services Department

My department provides [services and consulting](http://library.duke.edu/data/about) in data sources, data cleaning, analysis, data management, GIS and mapping, and Visualization.  Come crunch your data in our premier data analysis [computing lab](http://library.duke.edu/data/about/lab).  Additionally we sponsor an extensive workshop series: guides, data resources, and video recordings of our [Past Workshop](http://library.duke.edu/data/news/past-workshops) are available.  You can also RSVP for our [upcoming workshops](http://library.duke.edu/data/news).  Come see us during our [Walk-in](http://library.duke.edu/data/about/schedule) hours or contact us at askData@Duke.edu

## Other

My [slide-deck template](http://libjohn.github.io/slide-template/) integrates the Duke University [Color palette](https://styleguide.duke.edu/color-palette/) into the [Xaringan slide package](https://slides.yihui.name/xaringan/).  Compose your slides Rmarkdown and knit, your done.  Then go present and deliver the Duke-wow.  My next development step for this project is to further integrate the existing template into the Rstudio document template feature-set which will streamline your slide development even more.
