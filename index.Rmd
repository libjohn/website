## Other

My [slide-deck template](http://libjohn.github.io/slide-template/) integrates the Duke University [Color palette](https://styleguide.duke.edu/color-palette/) into the [Xaringan slide package](https://slides.yihui.name/xaringan/).  Compose your slides in Rmarkdown, knit, and your done.  Now go present and deliver the Duke-wow.  My next development step for this project is to further integrate the existing template into the Rstudio document template feature-set which will streamline your slide development even more.
